1.
* write stochastic process generator (see kloeden+platen ?)
  - e.g. realization of brownian motion
  - can use to generate time series of underlying prices
* write black-scholes pricer for options
  - maybe also PDE pricer... 
* write generator for family of related options
* simulate order flow!   random price-taking orders
