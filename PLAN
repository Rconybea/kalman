1.
DONE write stochastic process generator (see kloeden+platen ?)
  - e.g. realization of brownian motion
  - can use to generate time series of underlying prices
DONE write black-scholes pricer for options
  .. maybe also PDE pricer... 
DONE write generator for family of related options
DONE write StrikeSetOmdSimSource::advance_until()
DONE StrikeSetMarketModel to forward omd events to StrikeSetOmdSimSource
DONE generalize simulator,  allow not-ready sources

* StrikeSetOmdSim

* simulate order flow!   random price-taking orders
* add callbacks to StrikeSetOmdSimSource
